\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would thank my adviser Prof. Gustavo Scuseria for his guidance 
during the course of my graduate studies. His consistent support both in 
personal and academic aspects, as well as the atmosphere in his group shaped me 
as a researcher. 

During the years I was lucky to interact with Prof. Carlos 
Jim{\'e}nez-Hoyos, Dr. Ireneusz Bulik and Dr. Thomas Henderson,
who all taught me most of the important things to get started with the 
complicated craft of quantum chemistry. I am also grateful to Tom for reading 
and correcting multiple drafts of papers and manuscripts.

I would also thank Jinmo Zhao, Yiheng Qiu and Dr. Matthias Degroote for 
interesting discussions which started many ideas implemented in this work.
Special credit should go to Jinmo for his research on computer algebra 
systems, which made many projects possible, including this one.

Additionally, I would acknowledge Scuserians, including John Gomez, Dr. Jacob
Wahlen-Strothman, Dr. Kyle Throssell and others for making the group a great
place to work. My friends from Prof. Anatoly Kolomeisky's group, including 
Dr. Maria Kochugaeva and Dr. Alex Shvets, also contributed to make these 
years enjoyable.

During my graduate studies I was supported by The Department of Energy, award 
\# DE-SC0012575

Lastly, I am grateful to my family and my wife Irene for being a 
continuous source of inspiration and encouragement. Without their love and 
care this work would never be completed.
