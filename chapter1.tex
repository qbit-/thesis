\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:Motivation} Excellent error-rate performance in MIMO
environment are made possible by employing sophisticated algorithms
such as maximum \emph{a posteriori}~(MAP) detection techniques and
outer channel decoding that provides error-correction in the presence
of multiple access interference, burst channel fading, channel
multi-paths, additive receiver noise, etc. An approximation of
impractically complex optimal joint detection/decoding is achieved by
iteratively improving the \emph{a posteriori} probabilities (APPs) of
transmitted coded bits between inner soft detection and outer
decoding~\cite{almlof1991elimination}. Inner detection is typically
based on the simplification of exponentially complex
maximum-likelihood~(ML) approach such as the sphere
detection~\cite{purvis1982full}.
