\section{CPD-RCCSD method
\label{sec:cpd_rccsd}}
\subsection{Introduction}
Having success with THC-RCCSD, one may think of other possibilities to 
approximate coupled cluster with tensor decompositions. A major limitation of 
the THC-RCCSD is the need to calculate the decomposition of the Hamiltonian with 
iterative methods. Further, THC decomposition is defined only for four-index 
tensors, which limits its application in coupled cluster theories with higher 
than double excitation operators. 

Let us consider an alternative choice of factorizations of the Hamiltonian and 
excitation amplitudes, which still allows an effective calculation of the 
RCCSD updates. The two-electron integrals are approximated by an 
RI 
decomposition,\cite{koch2003reduced,harbrecht2012low,weigend2009approximated} 
which can be calculated with low effort and is readily available in 
most electronic structure programs, while doubles amplitudes are defined to 
have CP factorized form of rank $r_{T}$. Diagrammatically, these decompositions 
are:

Following the procedure described in Chapter~\ref{ch:tcc}, we derived 
an ALS-like update rule for the factors $Y \in \{Y^{1}, Y^{2}, Y^{3}, Y^{4}\}$. 
We call this method CPD-RCCSD. 
After defining proper intermediates with an automated algebraic 
system,\cite{drudge2} the cost of iteration in CPD-RCCSD is quartic in the 
basis size, auxiliary basis size and $r_{T}$.

CP decomposition was applied in the contest of RCCD before by Benedict and 
Auer\cite{benedict_ccd, benedict_mp2}. Although conceptually similar, our 
method significantly differs by the way one solves for the factors $Y$ of 
the ${}^2T$ amplitude and the use of standard RI decomposition of two electron 
integrals instead of CPD in the mentioned works.

To study the properties of this new method, we first apply it to weakly 
correlated problems used in the evaluation of 
THC-RCCSD.\cite{schutski2017tensor} Additionally, we show how our 
approximate CC methods work in strong correlation regime by simulating 
one dimensional Hubbard model\cite{essler2005one} and nitrogen 
dissociation.

\subsection{Computational details}
The CPD-RCCSD code is written in Python\cite{van2007python} on top of the 
PySCF\cite{sun2017python} electronic structure package. Hartree-Fock solutions, 
as well as two-electron integrals and density fitted integrals were 
provided by PySCF. For molecular systems we used standard cc-pVDZ basis set from 
the EMSL database,\cite{schuchardt2007basis} along with the cc-pVDZ-jkfit for 
RI decomposition. In case of Hubbard Hamiltonian~\ref{sec:hubbard_hamiltonian} 
the RI decomposition was built analytically.

For simulations of molecules in Table~\ref{tab:energies_cpd_rccsd} CC iterations 
were stopped after energy converged to within $10^{-6}~\mathrm{H}$ or a limit 
of 500 iterations was reached. In case of Hubbard Hamiltonian we used a 
threshold of $10^{-12}~\mathrm{H}$ for energy and 2000 iterations. The 
simulations presented in section~\ref{sec:strong_correlation} used up to 2000 
iterations, and $10^{-8}~\mathrm{H}$ convergence threshold. 

\subsection{CPD-RCCSD in weakly correlated systems}
To test the properties of CPD-RCCSD, we first apply it to weakly correlated 
Hubbard model (see Section~\ref{sec:hubbard_hamiltonian}). The convenience of 
the Hubbard Hamiltonian is that the two body interaction term in the on-site 
basis has simple structure. The full 4-index interaction in a model with $N$ 
sites is a diagonal tensor of size $N\times N\times N \times N$, having $\eta$ 
on the diagonal. Exact representations of the Hubbard interaction tensor in 
various forms can be easily built.

The exact RI representation ($V_{pqrs} = 
\eta \sum_{\alpha} U_{pr\alpha} \tilde{U}_{qs\alpha}$) of Hubbard interaction 
has rank $N$. Tree index RI factors can be chosen to be sparse $N 
\times N \times N$ tensors with elements $U_{ij\alpha} = \tilde{U}_{ij\alpha} 
= \delta_{i}^{\alpha} \delta_{j}^{\alpha} \cdot \sqrt{\eta}$. Likewise, an 
exact THC decomposition ($V_{pqrs} = \eta \sum_{\alpha \beta} W^{1}_{p\alpha} 
W^{2}_{r\alpha} X_{\alpha, \beta} W^{3}_{q\beta} W^{4}_{s\beta}$) has ranks 
equal $N$, and matrices $W \in \{W^{1}, W^{2}, W^{3}, W^{4}, X\}$ are identity 
matrices of size $N \times N$. The scalar $\eta$ can be absorbed into matrix 
$X$. Finally, an exact CP decomposition ($V_{pqrs} = \eta \sum_{\alpha} 
W^{1}_{p\alpha} W^{2}_{r\alpha} W^{3}_{q\alpha} W^{4}_{s\alpha}$) has rank $N$.
Factor matrices, as previously, are identities. Summarizing, all decompositions 
of the Hamiltonian considered in this work can be built exactly and have low 
ranks. The approximation, thus, affects only cluster amplitudes.

The energy of $6, 10, 14$ and $18$-site Hubbard model was 
calculated at $\eta = 2$.

As the graph demonstrates, the difference in the correlation energy 
between CPD-RCCSD and conventional RCCSD methods decays exponentially as the 
rank $r_{T}$ is increased, similarly to the THC-RCCSD method. At  
$r_{T} \sim N^{1.2} - N^{1.5}$ the difference induced by the decomposition 
of doubles amplitudes is less than $1 \textrm{mH}$, which an excellent 
approximation of RCCSD. 

To further assess the performance of CPD-RCCSD, we calculated he energy 
of a set of molecules, previously used for evaluating THC-RCCSD. The magnitude 
of $r_{T}$ is chosen to be a multiple of the size of the auxiliary basis used 
in the RI decomposition of the Hamiltonian.

The results in Table~\ref{tab:energies_cpd_rccsd} are similar to the results
of THC-RCCSD. As the rank $r_{T}$ is increased, the quality of approximation 
improves. Typical errors are around $5 mH$ for the rank of CPD of doubles 
amplitudes being twice bigger than the size of the auxiliary basis used in the 
decomposition of the Hamiltonian. The errors in CPD-RCCSD are around five times 
higher than in THC-RCCSD for the same rank values. We attribute this to the 
larger number of the parameters in THC-RCCSD, having $4 \cdot N r_{T} + 
r^{2}_{T}$ for parameterizing amplitudes versus $4 \cdot N r_{T}$ in CPD-RCCSD. 
The comparison of Tables~\ref{tab:energies_cpd_rccsd} and 
\ref{tab:energies_cpd_rccsd} shows, however, that the accuracy of CPD-RCCSD 
increases more monotonically with the size of the rank. We suspect that a 
cancellation of errors happens in case of THC-RCCSD because of the more 
complicated approximation to the Hamiltonian, and thous CPD-based coupled 
cluster provides a more predictable approximation.

\subsection{Conclusions}
To summarize, CPD-RCCSD provides an alternative efficient approximation to the 
coupled cluster with singles and doubles. Overall, CPD-RCCSD and THC-RCCSD 
have a similar accuracy and asymptotic scaling of computational cost. 
Practically, CPD-RCCSD is much faster due to the use of an efficient RI 
decomposition of the electron interaction in place of THC. Additional benefit 
of using canonical decomposition of amplitudes is that the method can be 
further generalized to higher order coupled cluster theories.
