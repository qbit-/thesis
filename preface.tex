\section*{Preface}

This thesis is based on research I have done in Prof. Gustavo Scuseria's group 
from 2012 to 2018, which resulted in the following publications:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Multireference symmetry-projected variational approaches for 
ground and excited states of the one-dimensional Hubbard model}
R. Rodríguez-Guzmán, C. A. Jiménez-Hoyos, R. Schutski, G. E. Scuseria,
Phys. Rev. B \textbf{87} (23), 235129
 \item \emph{Analytic energy gradient for the projected Hartree–Fock method}
R. Schutski, C.A. Jiménez-Hoyos, G.E. Scuseria
J Chem. Phys. \textbf{140} (20), 204101
 \item \emph{Tensor-structured coupled cluster theory}
R. Schutski, J. Zhao, T. M. Henderson, G. E. Scuseria
J Chem. Phys. \textbf{147} (18), 184113 
\end{itemize}

The main focus of this text is the optimization of coupled cluster theory 
described in the last article. Parts of Chapter~\ref{ch:app_tcc} present 
research intended for subsequent publications.
